Close Unused Blank Tabs
=======================
Every time a new tab is created, all blank tabs will be closed (except the active tab)

Close unused blank tabs Plus - A Firefox extension to close blank tabs that are not used

This is a fork of "Close unused blank tabs" created by Dustin Luck.

I have decided to make a small changes, since the original web extension has problems opening multiple links at once.

Author of the original web exension is not reacheable.
